### 1. Sum and Squares

[ex1.cpp](ex1.cpp) is a small program that uses hash maps (unordered maps) to find the numbers where perfect squares are also sum of sum numbers.
```
Exercise 1
The integer 36 has a peculiar property: it is a perfect square, and is also the sum of the integers from 1 through 8.
The next such number is 1225 which is 352, and the sum of the integers from 1 through 49.
Find the next number that is a perfect square and also the sum of a series 1...n.
This next number may be greater than 32767. You may use library functions that you know of, (or mathematical formulas) to make your program run faster.
It is also possible to write this program using for-loops to determine if a number is a perfect square or a sum of a series.
(Note: depending on your machine and your program, it can take quite a while to find this number.)
```   

I do not understand why they say it can take a while to find the number. I have a very old laptop and it takes less than a second to find the number. I am using a very simple algorithm to find the number. I am sure there are better algorithms out there. I am not sure if I am missing something.
